            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and the nutmeg until well blended.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, sugars, and vanilla. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, until combined.</li>
                <li>Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth.
                <li>Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins.</li>
                <li>Divide the batter between the prepared muffin cups, filling about 3/4 of the way to the top. Bake until the tops of the cupcakes are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool cupcakes in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack and cool them completely before frosting.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and salt with a handheld electric mixer on medium speed until very creamy, about 2 minutes.
                <li>For the creamiest frosting, sift the powdered sugar or whisk until most large lumps are gone.
                <li>Beat in the powdered sugar, a 1/4 cup at a time, until fluffy. Add an additional 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for a thicker frosting.
                <li>To make spiced frosting, beat in a pinch of ground cinnamon or cardamom.
                <li>Frost the cooled cupcakes and, if you’d like, top with coarsely chopped pecans.</li>
            </ol>
